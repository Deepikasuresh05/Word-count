# Word-count
## AIM:
To write a python program for getting the word count from a text.
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM: 
### Step 1:
Open The file in read mode and handle it in test mood
### Step 2: 
Read the text using read() function
### Step 3: 
Split the text using space seperator . We assume that words in sentence are seperated
### Step 4:  
The length of the split list should equal the numbers of words
### Step 5: 
You can refine the count bycleaning the stringprior to splitting or validating the words after splitting
